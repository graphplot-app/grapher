  <p>Social Cartography is an attempt to capture relationships as they evolve over time. </p>
  <p>To that end, social cartography will ask for a bunch of personal information about your family.</p>
  <p>I will attempt to keep that information safe, using modern javascript. I won't store the data on my server unless you explicitly share it.</p>
